# Bharat-Intern-Projects
So the project I have designed is a Handwritten Digit Recognition Project which is using Artificial Neural Network(ANN) 
which is a fundamental concept of Machine Learning.
It uses the Dataset MNIST which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0-9.
This project basicsally predicts the numbers based on the scanned handwritten digits.
This project was done by importing tensorflow and keras which are the important libraries in machine learning.
This concludes the task no.3 of Bharat Intern Data Science internship.
