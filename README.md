# Bharat-Intern-Projects
So the project I have designed under Bharat Intern projects are Handwritten Digit Recognition Project and is using Artificial Neural Network(ANN) 
and Stock Market prediction using LSTM.
ANN is a fundamental concept of Machine Learning.
It uses the Dataset MNIST which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0-9.
This project basicsally predicts the numbers based on the scanned handwritten digits.
This project was done by importing tensorflow and keras which are the important libraries in machine learning.
LSTM is a concept of Deep Learning which is a special type of Recurrent Neural netwok.
In the project we determined the Google Stock Price Prediction using the above concept.
This concludes the two tasks under Bharat Intern Virtual Internship.
